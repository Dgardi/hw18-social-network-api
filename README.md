# hw18-social-network-api

This app was created utilizing express, mongoose, and moment. 

I wanted to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I've used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

This can be started by typing NPM run start in a git bash terminal from the root folder.
